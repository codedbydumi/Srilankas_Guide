<p>City in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>Negombo is a city on the west coast of Sri Lanka, north of the capital, Colombo. Near the waterfront, the remains of the 17th-century Dutch Fort now house a prison. Negombo Lagoon, lined with fishermen’s huts, feeds into the Dutch-era Hamilton Canal. The canal leads south to Colombo. Neoclassical St. Mary’s Church, completed in the 1920s, features a ceiling decorated with vivid religious paintings.</p>
<p>Angurukaramulla Temple is known for its large Buddha statue, colorful murals and entrance shaped like a dragon's mouth. Just north of the city, Negombo Beach is lined with coconut trees and mangroves. It offers opportunities for diving, with coral reefs and a 20th-century shipwreck offshore. Local fishermen sell their catches directly on the beach and at the fish market nearby. Southeast of the city, Henarathgoda Botanical Gardens is filled with rubber trees and tropical plants from around the world.</p>

<p>Capital of Sri Lanka</p>
<p>Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka, has a long history as a port on ancient east-west trade routes, ruled successively by the Portuguese, Dutch and British. That heritage is reflected in its its architecture, mixing colonial buildings with high-rises and shopping malls. The imposing Colombo National Museum, dedicated to Sri Lankan history, borders sprawling Viharamahadevi Park and its giant Buddha.</p>
<p>The vibrant, jam-packed Pettah bazaar district's thousands of vendors offer everything from spices and tea to textiles and jewelry. Galle Face Green is an oceanside promenade popular for picnicking and strolling. The city's diverse religious landmarks range from the ornate, red-and-white-striped Jami Ul-Alfar Mosque and the historic Dutch Reformed Wolvendaal Church to the Buddhist Gangaramaya Temple complex. International matches of cricket, Sri Lanka's national passion, are played at Premadasa Stadium. The city is also a major hopping-off point for beaches in the island nation's south.</p>

<p>City in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>Galle is a city on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka. It’s known for Galle Fort, the fortified old city founded by Portuguese colonists in the 16th century. Stone sea walls, expanded by the Dutch, encircle car-free streets with architecture reflecting Portuguese, Dutch and British rule. Notable buildings include the 18th-century Dutch Reformed Church. Galle Lighthouse stands on the fort’s southeast tip.</p>
<p>The Old Gate, the fortification’s original entrance, bears the insignia of the Dutch East India Company. The gate leads to the National Maritime Museum, with exhibits focusing on seafaring and marine life, including a whale skeleton and items salvaged from shipwrecks. Galle National Museum, in a 1656 building, displays southern Sri Lankan artifacts such as ritual masks and woodcarvings, and objects from the colonial era. Just outside the northern fortifications, the Galle International Stadium hosts cricket matches with Indian Ocean views.</p>

<p>Town in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>Hikkaduwa is a seaside resort town in southwestern Sri Lanka. It’s known for its strong surf and beaches, including palm-dotted Hikkaduwa Beach, lined with restaurants and bars. The shallow waters opposite Hikkaduwa Beach shelter the Hikkaduwa National Park, which is a coral sanctuary and home to marine turtles and exotic fish. Inland, Gangarama Maha Vihara is a Buddhist temple decorated with hand-painted murals.</p>
<p>Nearby, Hikkaduwa Lake supports wildlife like monitor lizards and birds. To the north, on a small island just off the coast, is the revered temple of Seenigama Vihara. Nearby is the Hikkaduwa Turtle Farm and Hatchery, a sanctuary for several endangered turtle species, including hawksbills and leatherbacks. In the village of Telwatta, the Tsunami Photo Museum exhibits photos and salvaged items from the 2004 tsunami, which devastated this coastal area.
