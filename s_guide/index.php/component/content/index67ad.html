Most modern Sri Lankan Tamils claim descent from residents of\u00a0Jaffna Kingdom, a former kingdom in the north of the island and\u00a0Vannimai\u00a0chieftaincies\u00a0from the east. According to the anthropological and archaeological evidence, Sri Lankan Tamils have a very long\u00a0history in Sri Lanka\u00a0and have lived on the island since at least around the 2nd century\u00a0BCE.[18][19]\u00a0Today, they constitute a majority in the\u00a0Northern Province, live in significant numbers in the\u00a0Eastern Province\u00a0and are in the minority throughout the rest of the country. 70% of Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka live in the Northern and Eastern provinces.\r\nAlthough Sri Lankan Tamils are culturally and linguistically distinct, genetic studies indicate that they are closely related to the\u00a0Sinhalese\u00a0ethnic group in the island. The Sri Lankan Tamils are mostly\u00a0Hindus\u00a0with a significant\u00a0Christian\u00a0population.\u00a0Sri Lankan Tamil literature\u00a0on topics including religion and the sciences flourished during the medieval period in the court of the Jaffna Kingdom. Since the beginning of the\u00a0Sri Lankan Civil War\u00a0in the 1980s, it is distinguished by an emphasis on themes relating to the conflict.\u00a0Sri Lankan Tamil dialects\u00a0are noted for their\u00a0archaism\u00a0and retention of words not in everyday use in\u00a0Tamil Nadu, India.\r\nSince Sri Lanka gained\u00a0independence\u00a0from\u00a0Britain\u00a0in 1948, relations between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities have been strained. Rising ethnic and political tensions, along with\u00a0ethnic pogroms\u00a0carried out by Sinhalese mobs in\u00a01956,\u00a01958,\u00a01977,\u00a01981\u00a0and\u00a01983, led to the formation and strengthening of\u00a0militant groups\u00a0advocating\u00a0independence for Tamils. The ensuing\u00a0civil war\u00a0resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000\u00a0people and the\u00a0forced disappearance\u00a0of thousands of others. The civil war ended in 2009 but there are continuing\u00a0allegations of atrocities\u00a0being committed by the\u00a0Sri Lankan Military.[20][21]\u00a0A\u00a0United Nations panel\u00a0found that as many as 40,000 Tamil civilians may have been killed in the final months of the civil war.[22]\u00a0In January 2020, President\u00a0Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u00a0said that the estimated 20,000+ abducted Sri Lankan Tamil civilians were dead.[23]\u00a0The end of the civil war has not improved conditions in Sri Lanka, with press freedom not being restored and the judiciary coming under political control.[24][25][26]\r\nOne-third of Sri Lankan Tamils now live outside Sri Lanka. While there was significant migration during the British colonial period, the civil war led to more than 800,000\u00a0Tamils leaving Sri Lanka, and many have\u00a0left the country\u00a0for destinations such as India, Australia, Europe and Canada as refugees. The tensions and discrimination that Sri Lankan Tamils faced has resulted in many Sri Lankan Tamils today not identifying themselves as Sri Lankans but instead identifying themselves as\u00a0Eelam\u00a0Tamils or simply Tamils. Many also support\u00a0Tamil Eelam, a proposed\u00a0independent state\u00a0that Tamils in Sri Lanka and the\u00a0Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora\u00a0aspire to create in the north and east of Sri Lanka.[27][28][29]\u00a0Inspired by the\u00a0Tamil Eelam flag, the\u00a0tiger\u00a0has become a symbol of\u00a0Tamil nationalism\u00a0for Tamils in Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora...\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nTamil and Sinhala are the Main Nations in SriLanka..\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nReligion\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn 1981, about eighty percent of Sri Lankan Tamils were\u00a0Hindus\u00a0who followed the\u00a0Shaiva\u00a0sect.[125]\u00a0The rest were mostly Roman Catholics who converted after the\u00a0Portuguese conquest of Jaffna Kingdom. There is also a small minority of Protestants due to missionary efforts in the 18th century by organisations such as the\u00a0American Ceylon Mission.[126]\u00a0Most Tamils who inhabit the\u00a0Western Province\u00a0are Roman Catholics, while those of the\u00a0Northern\u00a0and\u00a0Eastern Provinces\u00a0are mainly Hindu.[127]\u00a0Pentecostal\u00a0and other churches, such as\u00a0Jehovah's Witnesses, are active among the internally displaced and refugee populations.[128]\u00a0The 2012 Sri Lanka Census revealed a\u00a0Buddhist\u00a0population of 22,254 amongst Sri Lankan Tamils. Accounting to roughly 1% of all Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka.[16]\r\nThe Hindu elite, especially the\u00a0Vellalar, follow the religious ideology of\u00a0Shaiva Siddhanta\u00a0(Shaiva school) while the masses practice\u00a0folk Hinduism, upholding their faith in local village deities not found in formal Hindu scriptures. The place of worship depends on the object of worship and how it is housed. It could be a proper Hindu temple known as a\u00a0Koyil, constructed according to the\u00a0Agamic\u00a0scripts (a set of scriptures regulating the temple cult). More often, however, the temple is not completed in accordance with\u00a0Agamic\u00a0scriptures but consists of the barest essential structure housing a local deity.[127]\u00a0These temples observe daily\u00a0Puja\u00a0(prayers) hours and are attended by locals. Both types of temples have a resident ritualist or priest known as a\u00a0Kurukkal. A\u00a0Kurukkal\u00a0may belong to someone from a prominent local lineage like\u00a0Pandaram\u00a0or Iyer community.[127]\u00a0In the Eastern Province, a\u00a0Kurukkal\u00a0usually belongs to\u00a0Lingayat\u00a0sect. Other places of worship do not have icons for their deities. The sanctum could house a\u00a0trident\u00a0(culam), a stone, or a large tree. Temples of this type are common in the Northern and Eastern Provinces; a typical village has up to 150 such structures. The offering would be done by an elder of the family who owns the site. A coconut oil lamp would be lit on Fridays, and a special rice dish known as\u00a0pongal\u00a0would be cooked either on a day considered auspicious by the family or on the\u00a0Thai Pongal\u00a0day, and possibly on\u00a0Tamil New Year Day.\r\n\u00a0\r\nCuisine\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere are several worshipped deities:\u00a0Ayyanar, Annamar,\u00a0Vairavar,\u00a0Kali,\u00a0Pillaiyar,\u00a0Murukan,\u00a0Kannaki Amman\u00a0and\u00a0Mariamman. Villages have more Pillaiyar temples, which are patronised by local farmers.[127]\u00a0Kannaki Amman is mostly patronised by maritime communities.[129]\u00a0Tamil Roman Catholics, along with members of other faiths, worship at the\u00a0Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu.[130]\u00a0Hindus have several temples with historic importance such as those at\u00a0Ketheeswaram,\u00a0Koneswaram,\u00a0Naguleswaram,\u00a0Munneswaram,\u00a0Tondeswaram, and\u00a0Nallur Kandaswamy.[131]\u00a0Kataragama\u00a0temple and\u00a0Adam's Peak\u00a0are attended by all religious communities.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPolitics\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nSri Lanka became an independent nation in 1948. Since independence, the political relationship between Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamil community has been strained. Sri Lanka has been unable to contain its ethnic violence as it escalated from sporadic terrorism to mob violence, and finally to civil war.[156]\u00a0The\u00a0Sri Lankan Civil War\u00a0has several underlying causes: the ways in which modern ethnic identities have been made and remade since the colonial period, rhetorical wars over archaeological sites and\u00a0place name etymologies, and the political use of the national past.[78]\u00a0The civil war resulted in the death of at least 100,000 people[157][158]\u00a0and, according to human rights groups such as\u00a0Human Rights Watch, the\u00a0forced disappearance\u00a0of thousands of others (see\u00a0White van abductions in Sri Lanka).[159][160][161]\u00a0Since 1983, Sri Lanka has also witnessed massive civilian displacements of more than a million people, with eighty percent of them being Sri Lankan Tamils...\r\n\u00a0\r\nLanguage\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSri Lankan Tamils predominantly speak Tamil and its Sri Lankan dialects. These dialects are differentiated by the phonological changes and sound shifts in their evolution from classical or old Tamil (3rd century BCE\u20137th century CE). The Sri Lankan Tamil dialects form a group that is distinct from the dialects of the modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala states of India. They are classified into three subgroups: the Jaffna Tamil, the Batticaloa Tamil, and the\u00a0Negombo Tamil dialects. These dialects are also used by ethnic groups other than Tamils such as the Sinhalese,\u00a0Moors\u00a0and Veddhas. Tamil loan words in Sinhala also follow the characteristics of Sri Lankan Tamil dialects.[132]\u00a0Sri Lankan Tamils, depending on where they live in Sri Lanka, may also additionally speak\u00a0Sinhala\u00a0and or\u00a0English. According to the 2012 Census 32.8% or 614,169 Sri Lankan Tamils also spoke Sinhala and 20.9% or 390,676 Sri Lankan Tamils also spoke English.[133]\r\nThe Negombo Tamil dialect is used by bilingual fishermen in the Negombo area, who otherwise identify themselves as Sinhalese. This dialect has undergone considerable convergence with spoken\u00a0Sinhala.[117]\u00a0The Batticaloa Tamil dialect is shared between Tamils, Muslims, Veddhas and\u00a0Portuguese Burghers\u00a0in the Eastern Province. Batticaloa Tamil dialect is the most literary of all the spoken dialects of Tamil. It has preserved several ancient features, remaining more consistent with the literary norm, while at the same time developing a few innovations. It also has its own distinctive vocabulary and retains words that are unique to present-day\u00a0Malayalam, a\u00a0Dravidian language\u00a0from Kerala that originated as a\u00a0dialect\u00a0of old Tamil around 9th century CE.[134][135]\u00a0The Tamil dialect used by residents of the Trincomalee District has many similarities with the Jaffna Tamil dialect.[132]\r\nThe dialect used in Jaffna is the oldest and closest to old Tamil. The long physical isolation of the Tamils of Jaffna has enabled their dialect to preserve ancient features of old Tamil that predate\u00a0Tolkappiyam,[132]\u00a0the grammatical treatise on Tamil dated from 3rd century BCE to 10th century CE.[136]\u00a0Also, a large component of the settlers were from the\u00a0Coromandel Coast\u00a0and\u00a0Malabar Coast\u00a0which may have helped with the preservation of the dialect.[137][138]\u00a0Their ordinary speech is closely related to classical Tamil.[132]\u00a0Conservational Jaffna Tamil dialect and Indian Tamil dialects are to an extent not mutually intelligible,[139]\u00a0and the former is frequently mistaken for\u00a0Malayalam\u00a0by native Indian Tamil speakers.\u00a0[140]\u00a0The closest Tamil Nadu Tamil variant to Jaffna Tamil is literary Tamil, used in formal speeches and news reading. There are also\u00a0Prakrit\u00a0loan words that are unique to Jaffna Tamil.... ",

A coconut oil lamp would be lit on Fridays, and a special rice dish known as\u00a0pongal\u00a0would be cooked either on a day considered auspicious by the family or on the\u00a0Thai Pongal\u00a0day, and possibly on\u00a0Tamil New Year Day.\r\n\u00a0\r\nCuisine\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere are several worshipped deities:\u00a0Ayyanar, Annamar,\u00a0Vairavar,\u00a0Kali,\u00a0Pillaiyar,\u00a0Murukan,\u00a0Kannaki Amman\u00a0and\u00a0Mariamman. Villages have more Pillaiyar temples, which are patronised by local farmers.[127]\u00a0Kannaki Amman is mostly patronised by maritime communities.[129]\u00a0Tamil Roman Catholics, along with members of other faiths, worship at the\u00a0Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu.[130]\u00a0Hindus have several temples with historic importance such as those at\u00a0Ketheeswaram,\u00a0Koneswaram,\u00a0Naguleswaram,\u00a0Munneswaram,\u00a0Tondeswaram, and\u00a0Nallur Kandaswamy.[131]\u00a0Kataragama\u00a0temple and\u00a0Adam's Peak\u00a0are attended by all religious communities.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPolitics\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nSri Lanka became an independent nation in 1948. Since independence, the political relationship between Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamil community has been strained. Sri Lanka has been unable to contain its ethnic violence as it escalated from sporadic terrorism to mob violence, and finally to civil war.[156]\u00a0The\u00a0Sri Lankan Civil War\u00a0has several underlying causes: the ways in which modern ethnic identities have been made and remade since the colonial period, rhetorical wars over archaeological sites and\u00a0place name etymologies, and the political use of the national past.[78]\u00a0The civil war resulted in the death of at least 100,000 people[157][158]\u00a0and, according to human rights groups such as\u00a0Human Rights Watch, the\u00a0forced disappearance\u00a0of thousands of others (see\u00a0White van abductions in Sri Lanka).[159][160][161]\u00a0Since 1983, Sri Lanka has also witnessed massive civilian displacements of more than a million people, with eighty percent of them being Sri Lankan Tamils...\r\n\u00a0\r\nLanguage\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSri Lankan Tamils predominantly speak Tamil and its Sri Lankan dialects. These dialects are differentiated by the phonological changes and sound shifts in their evolution from classical or old Tamil (3rd century BCE\u20137th century CE). The Sri Lankan Tamil dialects form a group that is distinct from the dialects of the modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala states of India. They are classified into three subgroups: the Jaffna Tamil, the Batticaloa Tamil, and the\u00a0Negombo Tamil dialects. These dialects are also used by ethnic groups other than Tamils such as the Sinhalese,\u00a0Moors\u00a0and Veddhas. Tamil loan words in Sinhala also follow the characteristics of Sri Lankan Tamil dialects.[132]\u00a0Sri Lankan Tamils, depending on where they live in Sri Lanka, may also additionally speak\u00a0Sinhala\u00a0and or\u00a0English. According to the 2012 Census 32.8% or 614,169 Sri Lankan Tamils also spoke Sinhala and 20.9% or 390,676 Sri Lankan Tamils also spoke English.[133]\r\nThe Negombo Tamil dialect is used by bilingual fishermen in the Negombo area, who otherwise identify themselves as Sinhalese. This dialect has undergone considerable convergence with spoken\u00a0Sinhala.[117]\u00a0The Batticaloa Tamil dialect is shared between Tamils, Muslims, Veddhas and\u00a0Portuguese Burghers\u00a0in the Eastern Province. Batticaloa Tamil dialect is the most literary of all the spoken dialects of Tamil. It has preserved several ancient features, remaining more consistent with the literary norm, while at the same time developing a few innovations. It also has its own distinctive vocabulary and retains words that are unique to present-day\u00a0Malayalam, a\u00a0Dravidian language\u00a0from Kerala that originated as a\u00a0dialect\u00a0of old Tamil around 9th century CE.[134][135]\u00a0The Tamil dialect used by residents of the Trincomalee District has many similarities with the Jaffna Tamil dialect.[132]\r\nThe dialect used in Jaffna is the oldest and closest to old Tamil. The long physical isolation of the Tamils of Jaffna has enabled their dialect to preserve ancient features of old Tamil that predate\u00a0Tolkappiyam,[132]\u00a0the grammatical treatise on Tamil dated from 3rd century BCE to 10th century CE.[136]\u00a0Also, a large component of the settlers were from the\u00a0Coromandel Coast\u00a0and\u00a0Malabar Coast\u00a0which may have helped with the preservation of the dialect.[137][138]\u00a0Their ordinary speech is closely related to classical Tamil.[132]\u00a0Conservational Jaffna Tamil dialect and Indian Tamil dialects are to an extent not mutually intelligible,[139]\u00a0and the former is frequently mistaken for\u00a0Malayalam\u00a0by native Indian Tamil speakers.\u00a0[140]\u00a0The closest Tamil Nadu Tamil variant to Jaffna Tamil is literary Tamil, used in formal speeches and news reading. There are also\u00a0Prakrit\u00a0loan words that are unique to Jaffna Tamil....",

Most modern Sri Lankan Tamils claim descent from residents of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffna_Kingdom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaffna Kingdom</a>, a former kingdom in the north of the island and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannimai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vannimai</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chieftaincy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chieftaincies</a> from the east. According to the anthropological and archaeological evidence, Sri Lankan Tamils have a very long <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history in Sri Lanka</a> and have lived on the island since at least around the 2nd century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BCE</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[18]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWenzlhuemer200819-20-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[19]</a> Today, they constitute a majority in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Province,_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Northern Province</a>, live in significant numbers in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Province,_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eastern Province</a> and are in the minority throughout the rest of the country. 70% of Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka live in the Northern and Eastern provinces.</p>
<p>Although Sri Lankan Tamils are culturally and linguistically distinct, genetic studies indicate that they are closely related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinhalese</a> ethnic group in the island. The Sri Lankan Tamils are mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hindus</a> with a significant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian</a> population. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamil_literature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sri Lankan Tamil literature</a> on topics including religion and the sciences flourished during the medieval period in the court of the Jaffna Kingdom. Since the beginning of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Civil_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sri Lankan Civil War</a> in the 1980s, it is distinguished by an emphasis on themes relating to the conflict. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamil_dialects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sri Lankan Tamil dialects</a> are noted for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">archaism</a> and retention of words not in everyday use in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamil Nadu</a>, India.</p>
<p>Since Sri Lanka gained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_independence_movement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independence</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Ceylon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Britain</a> in 1948, relations between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities have been strained. Rising ethnic and political tensions, along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riots_in_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethnic pogroms</a> carried out by Sinhalese mobs in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal_Oya_riots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1956</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_riots_in_Ceylon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1958</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_riots_in_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1977</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_Jaffna_library" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1981</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_July" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1983</a>, led to the formation and strengthening of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamil_militant_groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">militant groups</a> advocating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Eelam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independence for Tamils</a>. The ensuing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Civil_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">civil war</a> resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000 people and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforced_disappearances_in_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced disappearance</a> of thousands of others. The civil war ended in 2009 but there are continuing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alleged_war_crimes_during_the_final_stages_of_the_Sri_Lankan_Civil_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegations of atrocities</a> being committed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Military" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sri Lankan Military</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[20]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[21]</a> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report_of_the_Secretary-General%27s_Panel_of_Experts_on_Accountability_in_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Nations panel</a> found that as many as 40,000 Tamil civilians may have been killed in the final months of the civil war.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[22]</a> In January 2020, President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotabaya_Rajapaksa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gotabaya Rajapaksa</a> said that the estimated 20,000+ abducted Sri Lankan Tamil civilians were dead.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[23]</a> The end of the civil war has not improved conditions in Sri Lanka, with press freedom not being restored and the judiciary coming under political control.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[24]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[25]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-26" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[26]</a></p>
<p>One-third of Sri Lankan Tamils now live outside Sri Lanka. While there was significant migration during the British colonial period, the civil war led to more than 800,000 Tamils leaving Sri Lanka, and many have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamil_diaspora" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left the country</a> for destinations such as India, Australia, Europe and Canada as refugees. The tensions and discrimination that Sri Lankan Tamils faced has resulted in many Sri Lankan Tamils today not identifying themselves as Sri Lankans but instead identifying themselves as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eelam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eelam</a> Tamils or simply Tamils. Many also support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Eelam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamil Eelam</a>, a proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent state</a> that Tamils in Sri Lanka and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamil_diaspora" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora</a> aspire to create in the north and east of Sri Lanka.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[27]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[28]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[29]</a> Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_tamil_eelam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamil Eelam flag</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tiger</a> has become a symbol of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_nationalism#Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamil nationalism</a> for Tamils in Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora...</p>

<p>In 1981, about eighty percent of Sri Lankan Tamils were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hindus</a> who followed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaivism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shaiva</a> sect.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-RR-130" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[125]</a> The rest were mostly Roman Catholics who converted after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_conquest_of_Jaffna_Kingdom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portuguese conquest of Jaffna Kingdom</a>.

<p>The Hindu elite, especially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Vellalar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vellalar</a>, follow the religious ideology of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaiva_Siddhanta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shaiva Siddhanta</a> (Shaiva school) while the masses practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sri_Lankan_Tamil_village_deities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">folk Hinduism</a>, upholding their faith in local village deities not found in formal Hindu scriptures. The place of worship depends on the object of worship and how it is housed. It could be a proper Hindu temple known as a <em>Koyil</em>, constructed according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Āgama_(Hinduism)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Agamic</em></a> scripts (a set of scriptures regulating the temple cult). More often, however, the temple is not completed in accordance with <em>Agamic</em> scriptures but consists of the barest essential structure housing a local deity.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-FOOTNOTESivathamby199534%E2%80%9389-132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[127]</a> These temples observe daily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Puja</em></a> (prayers) hours and are attended by locals. Both types of temples have a resident ritualist or priest known as a <em>Kurukkal</em>. A <em>Kurukkal</em> may belong to someone from a prominent local lineage like <em>Pandaram</em> or Iyer community.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-FOOTNOTESivathamby199534%E2%80%9389-132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[127]</a> In the Eastern Province, a <em>Kurukkal</em> usually belongs to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingayat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Lingayat</em></a> sect. Other places of worship do not have icons for their deities. The sanctum could house a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trident</a> (<em>culam</em>), a stone, or a large tree. Temples of this type are common in the Northern and Eastern Provinces; a typical village has up to 150 such structures. The offering would be done by an elder of the family who owns the site. A coconut oil lamp would be lit on Fridays, and a special rice dish known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pongal_(dish)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>pongal</em></a> would be cooked either on a day considered auspicious by the family or on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_Pongal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thai Pongal</a> day, and possibly on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_New_Year#Festivals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamil New Year Day</a>.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka became an independent nation in 1948. Since independence, the political relationship between Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamil community has been strained. Sri Lanka has been unable to contain its ethnic violence as it escalated from sporadic terrorism to mob violence, and finally to civil war.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-Peebles-161" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[156]</a> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Civil_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sri Lankan Civil War</a> has several underlying causes: the ways in which modern ethnic identities have been made and remade since the colonial period, rhetorical wars over archaeological sites and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_place_name_etymology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">place name etymologies</a>, and the political use of the national past.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-FOOTNOTESpencer199023-82" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[78]</a> The civil war resulted in the death of at least 100,000 people<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-162" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[157]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-163" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[158]</a> and, according to human rights groups such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Human Rights Watch</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced disappearance</a> of thousands of others (<em>see </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_van_abductions_in_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>White van abductions in Sri Lanka</em></a>).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-164" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[159]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-165" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[160]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[161]</a> Since 1983, Sri Lanka has also witnessed massive civilian displacements of more than a million people, with eighty percent of them being Sri Lankan Tamils...</p>

<p>Sri Lankan Tamils predominantly speak Tamil and its Sri Lankan dialects. These dialects are differentiated by the phonological changes and sound shifts in their evolution from classical or old Tamil (3rd century BCE–7th century CE). The Sri Lankan Tamil dialects form a group that is distinct from the dialects of the modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala states of India. They are classified into three subgroups: the Jaffna Tamil, the Batticaloa Tamil, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negombo_Tamil_dialect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Negombo Tamil dialects</a>. These dialects are also used by ethnic groups other than Tamils such as the Sinhalese, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Moors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moors</a> and Veddhas. Tamil loan words in Sinhala also follow the characteristics of Sri Lankan Tamil dialects.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-Kuiper-137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[132]</a> Sri Lankan Tamils, depending on where they live in Sri Lanka, may also additionally speak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhala_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinhala</a> and or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English</a>. According to the 2012 Census 32.8% or 614,169 Sri Lankan Tamils also spoke Sinhala and 20.9% or 390,676 Sri Lankan Tamils also spoke English.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-Census2012-138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[133]</a></p>
<p>The Negombo Tamil dialect is used by bilingual fishermen in the Negombo area, who otherwise identify themselves as Sinhalese. This dialect has undergone considerable convergence with spoken <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhala_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinhala</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-Bonta-122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[117]</a> The Batticaloa Tamil dialect is shared between Tamils, Muslims, Veddhas and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Burghers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portuguese Burghers</a> in the Eastern Province. Batticaloa Tamil dialect is the most literary of all the spoken dialects of Tamil. It has preserved several ancient features, remaining more consistent with the literary norm, while at the same time developing a few innovations. It also has its own distinctive vocabulary and retains words that are unique to present-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malayalam</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dravidian language</a> from Kerala that originated as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dialect</a> of old Tamil around 9th century CE.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-FOOTNOTESubramaniam200610-139" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[134]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[135]</a> The Tamil dialect used by residents of the Trincomalee District has many similarities with the Jaffna Tamil dialect.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-Kuiper-137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[132]</a></p>
<p>The dialect used in Jaffna is the oldest and closest to old Tamil. The long physical isolation of the Tamils of Jaffna has enabled their dialect to preserve ancient features of old Tamil that predate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkappiyam" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Tolkappiyam</em></a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-Kuiper-137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[132]</a> the grammatical treatise on Tamil dated from 3rd century BCE to 10th century CE.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-141" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[136]</a> Also, a large component of the settlers were from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coromandel_Coast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coromandel Coast</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malabar_Coast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malabar Coast</a> which may have helped with the preservation of the dialect.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[137]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-143" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[138]</a> Their ordinary speech is closely related to classical Tamil.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-Kuiper-137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[132]</a> Conservational Jaffna Tamil dialect and Indian Tamil dialects are to an extent not mutually intelligible,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-144" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[139]</a> and the former is frequently mistaken for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malayalam</a> by native Indian Tamil speakers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIndrapala200745-145" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[140]</a> The closest Tamil Nadu Tamil variant to Jaffna Tamil is literary Tamil, used in formal speeches and news reading. There are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakrit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prakrit</a> loan words that are unique to Jaffna Tamil....</p> </div><!--/blog_post_content-->
