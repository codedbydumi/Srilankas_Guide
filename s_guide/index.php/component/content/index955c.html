The\u00a0Constitution of Sri Lanka\u00a0provides free education as a fundamental right. Sri Lanka's population had an adult literacy rate of 96.3% in 2015, which is above average by world and regional standards.Computer literacy in 2017 28.3% and phone users in 2017 105%, website users 32% in 2017\u00a0[note 1]\u00a0Education plays a major part in the life and culture of the country. which dates back to 543 BC. Sri Lanka's modern educational system was brought about by its integration into the\u00a0British Empire\u00a0in the 19th century. Education currently falls under the control of both the\u00a0Central Government\u00a0and the\u00a0Provincial Councils, with some responsibilities lying with the Central Government and the Provincial Council having autonomy for others....\r\n\u00a0\r\nPrimary and secondary education\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSri Lanka's education structure is divided into five parts: primary, junior secondary, senior secondary, collegiate, and tertiary.\u00a0Primary education\u00a0lasts five years (Grade 1 to Grade 5) and at the end of this period, the students may elect to write a national exam called the Scholarship exam. This exam allows students with exceptional skills to move on to better schools. After primary education, the junior secondary level (referred to as middle school in some schools) lasts for 4 years (Grades 6-9) followed by 2 years (Grades 10-11) of the senior secondary level which is the preparation for the\u00a0General Certificate of Education\u00a0(G.C.E)\u00a0Ordinary Level\u00a0(O\/Ls). According to the Sri Lankan law, it is compulsory that all children go to school till grade 9 (age 14) at which point they can choose to continue their education or drop out and engage in apprenticeship for a job or farming. However, the Ministry of Education strongly advises all students to continue with their studies at least till the G.C.E Ordinary Level. Students who are pursuing\u00a0tertiary education\u00a0must pass the G.C.E O\/Ls in order to enter the collegiate level to study for another 2 years (grades 12-13) to sit for the\u00a0G.C.E Advanced Level. On successful completion of this exam, students can move on to\u00a0tertiary education, there for the GCE A\/Ls is the university entrance exam in Sri Lanka.[13]\r\nDue to the variety of ethnic groups in Sri Lanka, many schools teach only in either\u00a0Sinhala\u00a0medium or in\u00a0Tamil\u00a0medium and not the\u00a0English\u00a0medium. The elite colleges in major cities such as\u00a0Colombo\u00a0and\u00a0Kandy, teach in all three media...\r\n\u00a0\r\nAge Gap\r\n\u00a0\r\nPrimary\r\n\r\nKindergarten: 3-5 year olds\r\nGrade 1: 5-6 year olds\r\nGrade 2: 6-7 year olds\r\nGrade 3: 7-8 year olds\r\nGrade 4: 8-9 year olds\r\nGrade 5: 9-10 year olds -\u00a0Scholarship Examination\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nJunior secondary\r\n\r\nGrade 6: 10-11 year olds\r\nGrade 7: 11-12 year olds\r\nGrade 8: 12-13 year olds\r\nGrade 9: 13-14 year olds\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nSenior secondary\r\n\r\nGrade 10: 14-15 year olds\r\nGrade 11: 15-16 year olds -\u00a0G.C.E Ordinary Level Examination\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nCollegiate\r\n\r\nGrade 12: 16-18 year olds\r\nGrade 13: 17-19 year olds -\u00a0G.C.E Advance Level Examination\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nSchools\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA standard system of government schools were begun by the British based on the recommendations of the\u00a0Colebrooke Commission\u00a0in 1836. This is regarded as the beginning of the government's schooling system in the island. It started with the establishment of the\u00a0Royal College\u00a0in\u00a0Colombo\u00a0(formerly the Colombo Academy) and lead to the formation of several\u00a0single sex schools\u00a0constructed during the colonial period, by the British.[5]\u00a0Some of these schools were affiliated to the Anglican Church. These included\u00a0S. Thomas' College\u00a0in\u00a0Mount Lavinia\u00a0and\u00a0Trinity College\u00a0in\u00a0Kandy. The education in\u00a0vernacular\u00a0schools was largely free due to government grants to cover the cost of teaching and local\u00a0philanthropists\u00a0providing the buildings, equipment and the books.[6]\u00a0Colebrooke decreed that all government schools be discontinued. The order did not apply to denominational Missionary schools and they continued to function unceasingly.\r\nIn 1938 the education system in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) was made formally free following the granting of\u00a0universal franchise\u00a0in 1931. The Minister of Education, late Hon. Dr.\u00a0C.W.W. Kannangara, and the Executive Committee of Education which included members such as\u00a0H. W. Amarasuriya\u00a0took the initiative in establishing\u00a0free education. Under this initiative the government established\u00a0Madhya Maha Vidyalayas\u00a0(MMV, Central Colleges) that were scattered around the island to provide education to all. The medium was either\u00a0Sinhala\u00a0or\u00a0Tamil.\r\nIn 1942 a special committee was appointed to observe the education system and, among the suggestions that followed, the following play an important role:\r\n\r\ni. Make available to all children a good education free of charge, so that education ceases to be a commodity purchasable only by the urban affluent.\r\nii. Make national languages the media of instruction in place of English so that opportunities for higher education, lucrative employment open only to small number of the urban affluent, would become available to others as well.\r\niii. Rationalize the school system so that educational provision is adequate, efficient and economical.\r\niv. Ensure that every child is provided with instruction in the religion of his\/her parents.\r\nv. Protect teachers from exploitation by managers of schools.\r\nvi. Make adequate provision for adult education.\r\n\r\nAfter independence, the number of schools and the literacy rate substantially increased. According to the Ministry of Statistics, today there are approximately 10,012 public schools serving close to 4,037,157 students, all around the island.\r\nDuring the colonial times, late\u00a0national heroes\u00a0like\u00a0Anagarika Dharmapala\u00a0with foreigners like\u00a0Colonel\u00a0Henry Steel Olcott\u00a0and\u00a0Madame Blavatsky\u00a0of the\u00a0Buddhist\u00a0Theosophical Society\u00a0installed Buddhist schools to foster\u00a0Sinhala\u00a0students with an\u00a0English\u00a0education rich in Buddhist values and to bring\u00a0Buddhism\u00a0to life, at a time when it was slowly fading away. Most of these schools were established in the capitals of the major\u00a0provinces of Sri Lanka. The first of these were\u00a0Ananda College, Colombo (formerly English Buddhist School);\u00a0Dharmaraja College, Kandy\u00a0(formerly Kandy Buddhist High School);\u00a0Mahinda College,\u00a0Galle\u00a0(formerly Galle Buddhist Theosophical Society School);[7]\u00a0Musaeus College, Colombo[8]\u00a0and\u00a0Maliyadeva College,\u00a0Kurunegala\u00a0(formerly Kurunegala Buddhist Institution) which were followed decades later by\u00a0Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo\u00a0(formerly Buddhist Girls College),\u00a0Nalanda Maha Vidyalaya Colombo\u00a0and\u00a0Mahamaya Vidyalaya, Kandy.\r\nSri Lanka also has many\u00a0Catholic schools\u00a0such as\u00a0St. Joseph's College,\u00a0St Bridget's Convent,\u00a0St Peter's College,\u00a0St. Anthony's College, Kandy\u00a0and the\u00a0Joseph Vaz College\u00a0named after the Sri Lankan saint\u00a0Joseph Vaz. The earliest schools such as\u00a0Richmond College, Galle,\u00a0Jaffna Central College,\u00a0Wesley College, Colombo,\u00a0Kingswood College, Kandy(formerly Boys' High School, Kandy);\u00a0Girls' High School, Kandy\u00a0and\u00a0Methodist College, Colombo\u00a0were started by the\u00a0Methodist Church.[9]\u00a0Many schools were built in the post-colonial era. However, the established schools who had their origins in the colonial era dominate social life in Sri Lanka mainly due networks of old boys and old girls.[citation needed]\r\nSeveral superficial changers to the school system took place in the post-independence era. These include the change of the primary medium of education to the national languages, nationalization of private schools and the introduction of national\/provisional school system.[citation needed]\r\nThere are 749 Muslim schools in Sri Lanka, 205 madrasas which teach Islamic education, and an Islamic university in Beruwala (Jamiya Naleemiya). Zahira College, Colombo is considered to be the oldest Muslim school initiated in the country by T. B. Jayah, while Al Iman Schools in Colombo was the first Islamic to teach an integrated Islamic curriculum since 2008..\r\n\u00a0\r\nGovernment schools\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMost of the schools in Sri Lanka are maintained by the government as a part of the free education. Currently there are 10,012 government schools with a student population of 4.2 million and 235,924 teachers, 736\u00a0Pirivenas\u00a0and also 104 private schools with 127,968 students.&lt;&gt; With the establishment if the provincial council system in the 1980s the central government handed control of most schools to local governments. However the old schools which had been around since the colonial times were retained by the central government, this creating three types of government schools;\r\n\r\nNational Schools\r\nProvincial Schools\r\nPirivenas-Schools for Buddhist priests\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nNational School\r\n\u00a0\r\nNational schools\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\ncome under the direct control of the\u00a0Ministry of Education\u00a0and therefore have direct funding from the ministry. Most of these schools were established during the colonial period and therefore are established institutions. These few are referred to as famous schools or elite schools since they have a rich history and better maintained facilities than the average public school. This is mainly due the support of their alumni. In recent years newer schools and several central colleges have been upgraded to national schools from time to time, thereby making the total number of national schools 350\r\n\u00a0\r\nProvincial Schools\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nconsists of the vast majority of schools in Sri Lanka. Funded and controlled by the local governments many suffer from poor facilities and a shortage of teachers.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPiriven\r\n\u00a0\r\nPiriven\u00a0are monastic colleges (similar to a\u00a0seminary) for the education of\u00a0Buddhist\u00a0priests. These have been the centers of secondary and higher education in ancient times for lay people as well. Today 561 Piriven are funded and maintained by the Ministry of Education under the\u00a0Pirivena Education Act, No, 64 of 1979. Young priests undergo training at these pirivenas prior to being their\u00a0Ordination\u00a0and study for GCE O\/L and A\/L examinations. They may gain entrance to State Universities for higher religious studies.\r\n\u00a0\r\nNon-Goverment Schools\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nPrivate schools\r\n\r\nC.M.S Ladies College one of Sri Lanka's private girls' school as seen from its grounds\r\nThere has been a considerable increase in the number of\u00a0private schools in Sri Lanka, due to the emergence of the upper-middle class during the colonial era. These private schools follow the local curriculum set up by the\u00a0Ministry of Education\u00a0in the local language mediums of\u00a0Sinhala,\u00a0Tamil\u00a0or\u00a0English. Many of the private schools have access to newer facilities than state run schools. Currently there are 66 Private schools (registered before 1960 and not since then) of these, 33 non-fee-levying Assisted Private Schools (also known as semi-government schools) and 33 fee levying autonomous\u00a0Private Schools, in addition to the Government Schools.\r\n\u00a0\r\nInternational schools\r\n\u00a0\r\nInternational schools\u00a0in Sri Lanka are not restricted to the expatriate community, anyone with the ability and willingness to pay can join these schools. Starting in the late 1980s these schools have no regulation or control by the Ministry of Education as it comes under the Board of Investment (BOI),[13]\u00a0due to this the standard of education varies greatly between schools. The schools are mainly for the children of the expatriate community, charge high tuition fees and can therefore provide good facilities and high standards.\r\nThe majority of International schools prepares students for the\u00a0Edexcel\u00a0General Certificate of Education\u00a0(IGCSE) Ordinary, Advanced Subsidiary (AS) and Advanced (A2) Level examinations, which is the most popular qualification. Preparation for\u00a0Cambridge International Examinations\u00a0is also offered by a few schools but it is less popular. Both exams are offered under the supervision of the\u00a0British Council, whereas some schools offer a direct partnership with the examination body in order to improve standards.\r\nMadrasas\r\n\u00a0\r\nAs of 2013, there are 205\u00a0madrasas\u00a0registered under the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs providing\u00a0Islamic education\u00a0in Sri Lanka.[14]\u00a0These have been build and maintained by independent Islamic foundations such as\u00a0All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama\u00a0and the Thareeqathul Aroosiyyathil Qaadhiriyyah Association in Sri Lanka which propagate\u00a0Sunnah wal Jamaah.[15]\u00a0This is in\r\naddition to the 749 Muslim Schools in Sri Lanka.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSemi Government Schools\r\n\u00a0\r\nThere are quite a few semi government schools in Sri Lanka which are run as a government private collaboration, where the government provides the text books, uniforms and other facilities such as the ability to sit for\u00a0national exams\u00a0and government paid teachers. The prominent semi government schools are\u00a0Zahira College, Colombo,\u00a0St. Joseph's College, Colombo\u00a0and\u00a0St. Peter's College, Colombo. ",

Ensure that every child is provided with instruction in the religion of his\/her parents.\r\nv. Protect teachers from exploitation by managers of schools.\r\nvi. Make adequate provision for adult education.\r\n\r\nAfter independence, the number of schools and the literacy rate substantially increased. According to the Ministry of Statistics, today there are approximately 10,012 public schools serving close to 4,037,157 students, all around the island.\r\nDuring the colonial times, late\u00a0national heroes\u00a0like\u00a0Anagarika Dharmapala\u00a0with foreigners like\u00a0Colonel\u00a0Henry Steel Olcott\u00a0and\u00a0Madame Blavatsky\u00a0of the\u00a0Buddhist\u00a0Theosophical Society\u00a0installed Buddhist schools to foster\u00a0Sinhala\u00a0students with an\u00a0English\u00a0education rich in Buddhist values and to bring\u00a0Buddhism\u00a0to life, at a time when it was slowly fading away. Most of these schools were established in the capitals of the major\u00a0provinces of Sri Lanka. The first of these were\u00a0Ananda College, Colombo (formerly English Buddhist School);\u00a0Dharmaraja College, Kandy\u00a0(formerly Kandy Buddhist High School);\u00a0Mahinda College,\u00a0Galle\u00a0(formerly Galle Buddhist Theosophical Society School);[7]\u00a0Musaeus College, Colombo[8]\u00a0and\u00a0Maliyadeva College,\u00a0Kurunegala\u00a0(formerly Kurunegala Buddhist Institution) which were followed decades later by\u00a0Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo\u00a0(formerly Buddhist Girls College),\u00a0Nalanda Maha Vidyalaya Colombo\u00a0and\u00a0Mahamaya Vidyalaya, Kandy.\r\nSri Lanka also has many\u00a0Catholic schools\u00a0such as\u00a0St. Joseph's College,\u00a0St Bridget's Convent,\u00a0St Peter's College,\u00a0St. Anthony's College, Kandy\u00a0and the\u00a0Joseph Vaz College\u00a0named after the Sri Lankan saint\u00a0Joseph Vaz. The earliest schools such as\u00a0Richmond College, Galle,\u00a0Jaffna Central College,\u00a0Wesley College, Colombo,\u00a0Kingswood College, Kandy(formerly Boys' High School, Kandy);\u00a0Girls' High School, Kandy\u00a0and\u00a0Methodist College, Colombo\u00a0were started by the\u00a0Methodist Church.[9]\u00a0Many schools were built in the post-colonial era. However, the established schools who had their origins in the colonial era dominate social life in Sri Lanka mainly due networks of old boys and old girls.[citation needed]\r\nSeveral superficial changers to the school system took place in the post-independence era. These include the change of the primary medium of education to the national languages, nationalization of private schools and the introduction of national\/provisional school system.[citation needed]\r\nThere are 749 Muslim schools in Sri Lanka, 205 madrasas which teach Islamic education, and an Islamic university in Beruwala (Jamiya Naleemiya). Zahira College, Colombo is considered to be the oldest Muslim school initiated in the country by T. B. Jayah, while Al Iman Schools in Colombo was the first Islamic to teach an integrated Islamic curriculum since 2008..\r\n\u00a0\r\nGovernment schools\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMost of the schools in Sri Lanka are maintained by the government as a part of the free education. Currently there are 10,012 government schools with a student population of 4.2 million and 235,924 teachers, 736\u00a0Pirivenas\u00a0and also 104 private schools with 127,968 students.&lt;&gt; With the establishment if the provincial council system in the 1980s the central government handed control of most schools to local governments. However the old schools which had been around since the colonial times were retained by the central government, this creating three types of government schools;\r\n\r\nNational Schools\r\nProvincial Schools\r\nPirivenas-Schools for Buddhist priests\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nNational School\r\n\u00a0\r\nNational schools\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\ncome under the direct control of the\u00a0Ministry of Education\u00a0and therefore have direct funding from the ministry. Most of these schools were established during the colonial period and therefore are established institutions. These few are referred to as famous schools or elite schools since they have a rich history and better maintained facilities than the average public school. This is mainly due the support of their alumni. In recent years newer schools and several central colleges have been upgraded to national schools from time to time, thereby making the total number of national schools 350\r\n\u00a0\r\nProvincial Schools\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nconsists of the vast majority of schools in Sri Lanka. Funded and controlled by the local governments many suffer from poor facilities and a shortage of teachers.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPiriven\r\n\u00a0\r\nPiriven\u00a0are monastic colleges (similar to a\u00a0seminary) for the education of\u00a0Buddhist\u00a0priests. These have been the centers of secondary and higher education in ancient times for lay people as well. Today 561 Piriven are funded and maintained by the Ministry of Education under the\u00a0Pirivena Education Act, No, 64 of 1979. Young priests undergo training at these pirivenas prior to being their\u00a0Ordination\u00a0and study for GCE O\/L and A\/L examinations. They may gain entrance to State Universities for higher religious studies.\r\n\u00a0\r\nNon-Goverment Schools\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nPrivate schools\r\n\r\nC.M.S Ladies College one of Sri Lanka's private girls' school as seen from its grounds\r\nThere has been a considerable increase in the number of\u00a0private schools in Sri Lanka, due to the emergence of the upper-middle class during the colonial era. These private schools follow the local curriculum set up by the\u00a0Ministry of Education\u00a0in the local language mediums of\u00a0Sinhala,\u00a0Tamil\u00a0or\u00a0English. Many of the private schools have access to newer facilities than state run schools. Currently there are 66 Private schools (registered before 1960 and not since then) of these, 33 non-fee-levying Assisted Private Schools (also known as semi-government schools) and 33 fee levying autonomous\u00a0Private Schools, in addition to the Government Schools.\r\n\u00a0\r\nInternational schools\r\n\u00a0\r\nInternational schools\u00a0in Sri Lanka are not restricted to the expatriate community, anyone with the ability and willingness to pay can join these schools. Starting in the late 1980s these schools have no regulation or control by the Ministry of Education as it comes under the Board of Investment (BOI),[13]\u00a0due to this the standard of education varies greatly between schools. The schools are mainly for the children of the expatriate community, charge high tuition fees and can therefore provide good facilities and high standards.\r\nThe majority of International schools prepares students for the\u00a0Edexcel\u00a0General Certificate of Education\u00a0(IGCSE) Ordinary, Advanced Subsidiary (AS) and Advanced (A2) Level examinations, which is the most popular qualification. Preparation for\u00a0Cambridge International Examinations\u00a0is also offered by a few schools but it is less popular. Both exams are offered under the supervision of the\u00a0British Council, whereas some schools offer a direct partnership with the examination body in order to improve standards.\r\nMadrasas\r\n\u00a0\r\nAs of 2013, there are 205\u00a0madrasas\u00a0registered under the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs providing\u00a0Islamic education\u00a0in Sri Lanka.[14]\u00a0These have been build and maintained by independent Islamic foundations such as\u00a0All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama\u00a0and the Thareeqathul Aroosiyyathil Qaadhiriyyah Association in Sri Lanka which propagate\u00a0Sunnah wal Jamaah.[15]\u00a0This is in\r\naddition to the 749 Muslim Schools in Sri Lanka.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSemi Government Schools\r\n\u00a0\r\nThere are quite a few semi government schools in Sri Lanka which are run as a government private collaboration, where the government provides the text books, uniforms and other facilities such as the ability to sit for\u00a0national exams\u00a0and government paid teachers. The prominent semi government schools are\u00a0Zahira College, Colombo,\u00a0St. Joseph's College, Colombo\u00a0and\u00a0St. Peter's College, Colombo.",

<p><strong>Education in </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Sri Lanka</strong></a> has a long history that dates back two millennia. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constitution of Sri Lanka</a> provides free education as a fundamental right. Sri Lanka's population had an adult literacy rate of 96.3% in 2015, which is above average by world and regional standards.Computer literacy in 2017 28.3% and phone users in 2017 105%, website users 32% in 2017 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Sri_Lanka#cite_note-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[note 1]</a> Education plays a major part in the life and culture of the country. which dates back to 543 BC. Sri Lanka's modern educational system was brought about by its integration into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British Empire</a> in the 19th century. Education currently falls under the control of both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Central Government</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Provincial Councils</a>, with some responsibilities lying with the Central Government and the Provincial Council having autonomy for others....</p>

<p>Sri Lanka's education structure is divided into five parts: primary, junior secondary, senior secondary, collegiate, and tertiary. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary education</a> lasts five years (Grade 1 to Grade 5) and at the end of this period, the students may elect to write a national exam called the Scholarship exam. This exam allows students with exceptional skills to move on to better schools. After primary education, the junior secondary level (referred to as middle school in some schools) lasts for 4 years (Grades 6-9) followed by 2 years (Grades 10-11) of the senior secondary level which is the preparation for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Certificate of Education</a> (G.C.E) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_Level_(SL)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ordinary Level</a> (O/Ls). According to the Sri Lankan law, it is compulsory that all children go to school till grade 9 (age 14) at which point they can choose to continue their education or drop out and engage in apprenticeship for a job or farming. However, the Ministry of Education strongly advises all students to continue with their studies at least till the G.C.E Ordinary Level. Students who are pursuing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tertiary education</a> must pass the G.C.E O/Ls in order to enter the collegiate level to study for another 2 years (grades 12-13) to sit for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Level_(SL)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G.C.E Advanced Level</a>. On successful completion of this exam, students can move on to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tertiary education</a>, there for the GCE A/Ls is the university entrance exam in Sri Lanka.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Sri_Lanka#cite_note-MOE-14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[13]</a></p>
<p>Due to the variety of ethnic groups in Sri Lanka, many schools teach only in either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinhala</a> medium or in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamil</a> medium and not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English</a> medium. The elite colleges in major cities such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colombo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kandy</a>, teach in all three media...</p>

<p>A standard system of government schools were begun by the British based on the recommendations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colebrooke-Cameron_Commission" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colebrooke Commission</a> in 1836. This is regarded as the beginning of the government's schooling system in the island. It started with the establishment of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College,_Colombo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Royal College</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colombo</a> (formerly the Colombo Academy) and lead to the formation of several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sex_schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single sex schools</a> constructed during the colonial period, by the British.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Sri_Lanka#cite_note-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[5]</a> Some of these schools were affiliated to the Anglican Church. These included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Thomas%27_College" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S. Thomas' College</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehiwala-Mount_Lavinia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount Lavinia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Kandy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trinity College</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kandy</a>. The education in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vernacular</a> schools was largely free due to government grants to cover the cost of teaching and local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">philanthropists</a> providing the buildings, equipment and the books.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Sri_Lanka#cite_note-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[6]</a> Colebrooke decreed that all government schools be discontinued. The order did not apply to denominational Missionary schools and they continued to function unceasingly.</p>
<p>In 1938 the education system in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) was made formally free following the granting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_franchise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universal franchise</a> in 1931. The Minister of Education, late Hon. Dr. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.W.W._Kannangara" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C.W.W. Kannangara</a>, and the Executive Committee of Education which included members such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._W._Amarasuriya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H. W. Amarasuriya</a> took the initiative in establishing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free education</a>. Under this initiative the government established <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Maha_Vidyalayas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Madhya Maha Vidyalayas</a> (MMV, Central Colleges) that were scattered around the island to provide education to all. The medium was either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinhala</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamil</a>.</p>
<p>In 1942 a special committee was appointed to observe the education system and, among the suggestions that followed, the following play an important role:</p>
<ul>
<li>i. Make available to all children a good education free of charge, so that education ceases to be a commodity purchasable only by the urban affluent.</li>
<li>ii. Make national languages the media of instruction in place of English so that opportunities for higher education, lucrative employment open only to small number of the urban affluent, would become available to others as well.</li>
<li>iii. Rationalize the school system so that educational provision is adequate, efficient and economical.</li>
<li>iv. Ensure that every child is provided with instruction in the religion of his/her parents.</li>
<li>v. Protect teachers from exploitation by managers of schools.</li>
<li>vi. Make adequate provision for adult education.</li>
</ul>
<p>After independence, the number of schools and the literacy rate substantially increased. According to the Ministry of Statistics, today there are approximately 10,012 public schools serving close to 4,037,157 students, all around the island.</p>
<p>During the colonial times, late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_heroes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national heroes</a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagarika_Dharmapala" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anagarika Dharmapala</a> with foreigners like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colonel</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Steel_Olcott" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henry Steel Olcott</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Blavatsky" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Madame Blavatsky</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buddhist</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophical_Society" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theosophical Society</a> installed Buddhist schools to foster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinhala</a> students with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English</a> education rich in Buddhist values and to bring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buddhism</a> to life, at a time when it was slowly fading away. Most of these schools were established in the capitals of the major <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provinces of Sri Lanka</a>. The first of these were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ananda_College" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ananda College</a>, Colombo (formerly English Buddhist School); <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmaraja_College,_Kandy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dharmaraja College, Kandy</a> (formerly Kandy Buddhist High School); <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahinda_College" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mahinda College</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galle</a> (formerly Galle Buddhist Theosophical Society School);<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Sri_Lanka#cite_note-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[7]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musaeus_College" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Musaeus College</a>, Colombo<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Sri_Lanka#cite_note-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[8]</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maliyadeva_College" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maliyadeva College</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurunegala" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kurunegala</a> (formerly Kurunegala Buddhist Institution) which were followed decades later by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visakha_Vidyalaya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo</a> (formerly Buddhist Girls College), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalanda_Maha_Vidyalaya_Colombo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nalanda Maha Vidyalaya Colombo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahamaya_Girls%27_College,_Kandy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mahamaya Vidyalaya, Kandy</a>.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka also has many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_school" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catholic schools</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Joseph%27s_College,_Colombo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Joseph's College</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Bridget%27s_Convent,_Colombo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St Bridget's Convent</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Peter%27s_College,_Colombo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St Peter's College</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Anthony%27s_College,_Kandy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Anthony's College, Kandy</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Vaz_College" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joseph Vaz College</a> named after the Sri Lankan saint <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Vaz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joseph Vaz</a>. The earliest schools such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_College_(Sri_Lanka)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richmond College, Galle</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffna_Central_College" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaffna Central College</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_College,_Colombo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wesley College, Colombo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingswood_College,_Kandy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingswood College, Kandy</a>(formerly Boys' High School, Kandy); <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls%27_High_School,_Kandy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Girls' High School, Kandy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodist_College,_Colombo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Methodist College, Colombo</a> were started by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodist_Church" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Methodist Church</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Sri_Lanka#cite_note-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[9]</a> Many schools were built in the post-colonial era. However, the established schools who had their origins in the colonial era dominate social life in Sri Lanka mainly due networks of old boys and old girls.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>citation needed</em></a>]</p>
<p>Several superficial changers to the school system took place in the post-independence era. These include the change of the primary medium of education to the national languages, nationalization of private schools and the introduction of national/provisional school system.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>citation needed</em></a>]</p>
<p>There are 749 Muslim schools in Sri Lanka, 205 madrasas which teach Islamic education, and an Islamic university in Beruwala (Jamiya Naleemiya). Zahira College, Colombo is considered to be the oldest Muslim school initiated in the country by T. B. Jayah, while Al Iman Schools in Colombo was the first Islamic to teach an integrated Islamic curriculum since 2008..</p>

<h2><strong><u>Government schools</u></strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../../i0.wp.com/studentlanka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Government-schools-in-Sri-Lanka658f.jpg?fit=700%2C525&amp;ssl=1&amp;resize=1280%2C720" alt="Apply A/L classes in Government Schools based on O/L results" width="885" height="498" /></p>
<p>Most of the schools in Sri Lanka are maintained by the government as a part of the free education. Currently there are 10,012 government schools with a student population of 4.2 million and 235,924 teachers, 736 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirivenas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pirivenas</a> and also 104 private schools with 127,968 students.&lt;&gt; With the establishment if the provincial council system in the 1980s the central government handed control of most schools to local governments. However the old schools which had been around since the colonial times were retained by the central government, this creating three types of government schools;</p>
<ul>
<li>National Schools</li>
<li>Provincial Schools</li>
<li>Pirivenas-Schools for Buddhist priests</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><u>National School</u></strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_school_(Sri_Lanka)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>National schools</strong></a><strong> </strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>come under the direct control of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Sri_Lanka)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ministry of Education</a> and therefore have direct funding from the ministry. Most of these schools were established during the colonial period and therefore are established institutions. These few are referred to as famous schools or elite schools since they have a rich history and better maintained facilities than the average public school. This is mainly due the support of their alumni. In recent years newer schools and several central colleges have been upgraded to national schools from time to time, thereby making the total number of national schools 350</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_schools_in_Sri_Lanka#Provincial_schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Provincial Schools</strong></a><strong> </strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>consists of the vast majority of schools in Sri Lanka. Funded and controlled by the local governments many suffer from poor facilities and a shortage of teachers.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>Piriven</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirivena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piriven</a> are monastic colleges (similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seminary</a>) for the education of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buddhist</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">priests</a>. These have been the centers of secondary and higher education in ancient times for lay people as well. Today 561 Piriven are funded and maintained by the Ministry of Education under the <em>Pirivena Education Act, No, 64 of 1979</em>. Young priests undergo training at these pirivenas prior to being their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ordination</a> and study for GCE O/L and A/L examinations. They may gain entrance to State Universities for higher religious studies.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Non-Goverment Schools</u></strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><u>Private schools</u></strong></h2>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../../siscolombo.lk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Inside-a-classroom.jpg" alt="Private Education in Sri Lanka | About Private Education in Sri Lanka" /></p>
<p>C.M.S Ladies College one of Sri Lanka's private girls' school as seen from its grounds</p>
<p>There has been a considerable increase in the number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_schools_in_Sri_Lanka#Private_schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private schools in Sri Lanka</a>, due to the emergence of the upper-middle class during the colonial era. These private schools follow the local curriculum set up by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Sri_Lanka)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ministry of Education</a> in the local language mediums of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinhala</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamil</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English</a>. Many of the private schools have access to newer facilities than state run schools. Currently there are 66 Private schools (registered before 1960 and not since then) of these, 33 non-fee-levying Assisted Private Schools (also known as semi-government schools) and 33 fee levying autonomous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_School" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Private Schools</a>, in addition to the Government Schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><u>International schools</u></strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_schools_in_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International schools</a> in Sri Lanka are not restricted to the expatriate community, anyone with the ability and willingness to pay can join these schools. Starting in the late 1980s these schools have no regulation or control by the Ministry of Education as it comes under the Board of Investment (BOI),<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Sri_Lanka#cite_note-MOE-14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[13]</a> due to this the standard of education varies greatly between schools. The schools are mainly for the children of the expatriate community, charge high tuition fees and can therefore provide good facilities and high standards.</p>
<p>The majority of International schools prepares students for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edexcel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edexcel</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Certificate of Education</a> (IGCSE) Ordinary, Advanced Subsidiary (AS) and Advanced (A2) Level examinations, which is the most popular qualification. Preparation for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_International_Examinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cambridge International Examinations</a> is also offered by a few schools but it is less popular. Both exams are offered under the supervision of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Council" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British Council</a>, whereas some schools offer a direct partnership with the examination body in order to improve standards.</p>
<h2><strong><u>Madrasas</u></strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>As of 2013, there are 205 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrasas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">madrasas</a> registered under the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs providing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Islamic education</a> in Sri Lanka.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Sri_Lanka#cite_note-15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[14]</a> These have been build and maintained by independent Islamic foundations such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Ceylon_Jamiyyathul_Ulama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama</a> and the Thareeqathul Aroosiyyathil Qaadhiriyyah Association in Sri Lanka which propagate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahlus-Sunnah_wa’l-Jama’ah" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunnah wal Jamaah</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Sri_Lanka#cite_note-16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[15]</a> This is in</p>
<p>addition to the 749 Muslim Schools in Sri Lanka.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong><u>Semi Government Schools</u></strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>There are quite a few semi government schools in Sri Lanka which are run as a government private collaboration, where the government provides the text books, uniforms and other facilities such as the ability to sit for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_exams&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national exams</a> and government paid teachers.
