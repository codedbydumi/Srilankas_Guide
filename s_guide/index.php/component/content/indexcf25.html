The Sinhalese people speak\u00a0Sinhala, an\u00a0Indo-Aryan language, and are predominantly\u00a0Theravada Buddhists,[12]\u00a0although a small percentage of Sinhalese follow branches of\u00a0Christianity. The Sinhalese are mostly found in North Central, Central, South, and West Sri Lanka. According to the 5th\u00a0century epic poem\u00a0Mahavamsa\u00a0and the\u00a0Dipavamsa, a 3rd\u20135th\u00a0century treatise written in\u00a0Pali\u00a0by Buddhist monks of the\u00a0Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya\u00a0in\u00a0Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese descend from the\u00a0Indo Aryan\u00a0settlers who came to the island in 543\u00a0BCE\u00a0from\u00a0Sinhapura, in India, led by\u00a0Prince Vijaya.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nSri-Lanka Is Sinhala Buddist Country.\r\nSinhala Is Main Language.\r\nBuddist and Catholic are Main Religions, IN Srilanka.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nDress\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTraditionally during recreation the Sinhalese wear a\u00a0sarong\u00a0(sarama\u00a0in Sinhala). Men may wear a long-sleeved shirt with the sarong, while women wear a tight-fitting, short-sleeved jacket with a wrap-around called the\u00a0cheeththaya. In the more populated areas, Sinhalese men also wear Western-style clothing \u2014 wearing suits while the women wear skirts and blouses. For formal and ceremonial occasions women wear the traditional\u00a0Kandyan\u00a0(Osaria) style, which consists of a full blouse which covers the midriff completely, and is partially tucked in at the front. However, modern intermingling of styles has led to most wearers baring the midriff. The Kandyan style is considered as the national dress of Sinhalese women. In many occasions and functions, even the\u00a0saree\u00a0plays an important role in women's clothing and has become the de facto clothing for female office workers especially in government sector. An example of its use is the uniform of air hostesses of\u00a0Sri-Lanka AirLine.\r\n\u00a0\r\nReligion\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe form of Buddhism in Sri Lanka is known as\u00a0Theravada\u00a0(school of elders). The Pali chronicles (e.g., the Mahavansa) claim that the Sinhalese as an ethnic group are destined to preserve and protect Buddhism. In 1988 almost 93% of the Sinhala speaking population in Sri Lanka were Buddhist.[42]\u00a0Observations of current religious beliefs and practices demonstrate that the Sinhalese, as a religious community, have a complex worldview as Buddhists. Due to the proximity and on some occasions similarity of certain doctrines, there are many areas where Buddhists and Hindus share religious views and practices. This can lead to the opinion that Buddhists have adopted religious elements from Hindu traditions in their religious practices. Some of these practices may relate to ancient indigenous beliefs and traditions on spirits, worship of deities and godlings and some figures appear to\u00a0demons. Some of these demonic figures are used in healing rituals and may be native to the island.[39][43][44]\r\nProminent Sri Lankan anthropologists\u00a0Gananath Obeyesekere\u00a0and\u00a0Kitsiri Malalgoda\u00a0used the term \"Protestant Buddhism\" to describe a type of Buddhism that appeared among the Sinhalese in Sri Lanka as a response to\u00a0Protestant Christian\u00a0missionaries\u00a0and their evangelical activities during the British colonial period. This kind of Buddhism involved emulating the Protestant strategies of organising religious practices. They saw the need to establish Buddhist schools for educating Buddhist youth and organising Buddhists with new organisations such as the Young Men's Buddhist Association, as well as printing pamphlets to encourage people to participate in debates and religious controversies to defend Buddhism.[45]\r\nThere is a significant Sinhalese\u00a0Christian\u00a0community, in the maritime provinces of Sri Lanka.[39]\u00a0Christianity was brought to the Sinhalese by Portuguese, Dutch, and British missionary groups during their respective periods of rule.[46]\u00a0Most Sinhalese Christians are\u00a0Roman Catholic; a minority are\u00a0Protestant.[42]\u00a0Their cultural centre is\u00a0Negombo.\r\nReligion is considered very important among the Sinhalese. According to a 2008\u00a0Gallup poll, 99% of Sri Lankans considered religion an important aspect of their daily lives..\r\n\u00a0\r\nCuisine\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSinhalese cuisine is one of the most complex cuisines of\u00a0South Asia. As a major trade hub, it draws influence from\u00a0colonial powers\u00a0that were involved in\u00a0Sri Lanka\u00a0and by foreign traders.\u00a0Rice, which is consumed daily, can be found at any occasion, while spicy\u00a0curries\u00a0are favourite dishes for\u00a0lunch\u00a0and\u00a0dinner.[57]\u00a0Some of the Sri Lankan dishes have striking resemblance to\u00a0Kerala cuisine, which could be due to the similar geographic and agricultural features with\u00a0Kerala. A well-known rice dish with Sinhalese is\u00a0Kiribath, meaning \"Milk Rice.\" In addition to sambols, Sinhalese eat \"Mallung\"- chopped leaves mixed with grated\u00a0coconut\u00a0and red\u00a0onions.\u00a0Coconut milk\u00a0is found in most Sri Lankan dishes to give the cuisine its unique flavour.\r\nSri Lanka has long been renowned for its\u00a0spices. The best known is cinnamon which is native to Sri Lanka. In the 15th and 16th centuries, spice and ivory traders from all over the world who came to Sri Lanka brought their native cuisines to the island, resulting in a rich diversity of cooking styles and techniques. Lamprais rice boiled in stock with a special\u00a0curry, accompanied by\u00a0frikkadels\u00a0(meatballs), all of which is then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked as a Dutch-influenced Sri Lankan dish. Dutch and Portuguese sweets also continue to be popular. British influences include\u00a0roast beef\u00a0and\u00a0roast chicken. Also, the influence of the Indian cooking methods and food have played a major role in what Sri Lankans eat.\r\nThe island nation's cuisine mainly consists of boiled or steamed rice served with curry. This usually consists of a \"main curry\" of\u00a0fish\u00a0or\u00a0chicken, as well as several other curries made with\u00a0vegetables,\u00a0lentils\u00a0and even\u00a0fruit\u00a0curries. Side-dishes include\u00a0pickles,\u00a0chutneys\u00a0and \"sambols\". The most famous of these is the\u00a0coconut sambol, made of ground coconut mixed with\u00a0chili peppers, dried\u00a0Maldive fish\u00a0and\u00a0lime juice. This is ground to a paste and eaten with rice, as it gives zest to the meal and is believed to increase appetite.\r\n\u00a0\r\nMusic\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nConcerning popular music,\u00a0Ananda Samarakoon\u00a0developed the reflective and poignant Sarala gee style with his work in the late 1930s\/early 1940s. He has been followed by artists of repute such as\u00a0Sunil Shantha,\u00a0W. D. Amaradeva,\u00a0Premasiri Khemadasa,\u00a0Nanda Malini,\u00a0Victor Ratnayake, Austin Munasinghe,\u00a0T. M. Jayaratne,\u00a0Sanath Nandasiri,\u00a0Sunil Edirisinghe, Neela Wickremasinghe,\u00a0Gunadasa Kapuge, Malini Bulathsinghala and\u00a0Edward Jayakody....\r\n\u00a0\r\nFilm And theater\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDramatist\u00a0Ediriweera Sarachchandra\u00a0revitalised the drama form with\u00a0Maname\u00a0in 1956. The same year, film director\u00a0Lester James Peries\u00a0created the artistic masterwork\u00a0Rekava\u00a0which sought to create a uniquely Sinhalese cinema with artistic integrity. Since then, Peries and other directors like\u00a0Vasantha Obeysekera,\u00a0Dharmasena Pathiraja,\u00a0Mahagama Sekera, W. A. B. de Silva,\u00a0Dharmasiri Bandaranayake,\u00a0Sunil Ariyaratne,\u00a0Siri Gunasinghe, G. D. L. Perera, Piyasiri Gunaratne,\u00a0Titus Thotawatte,\u00a0D. B. Nihalsinghe, Ranjith Lal,\u00a0Dayananda Gunawardena, Mudalinayake Somaratne,\u00a0Asoka Handagama, and\u00a0Prasanna Vithanage\u00a0have developed an artistic Sinhalese cinema. Sinhala cinema is often made colourful with the incorporation of songs and dance adding more uniqueness to the industry.\r\nIn the recent years high budget films like\u00a0Aloko Udapadi,\u00a0Aba (film)\u00a0and\u00a0Maharaja Gemunu\u00a0based on Sinhalese\u00a0epic\u00a0historical\u00a0stories gain huge success...\r\n\u00a0\r\nMedicine\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTraditional Sinhalese villages in early days had at least one chief Medical personnel called Weda Mahaththaya (Doctor). These people practice their clinical activities by inheritance. Sinhalese Medicine resembles some of Ayurvedic practices in contrast for some treatments they use Buddhist Chantings (Pirith) in order to strengthen the effectiveness.\r\nAccording to the\u00a0Mahavamsa, the ancient chronicle,\u00a0Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka\u00a0(437 BC-367 BC) had lying-in-homes and Ayurvedic hospitals (Sivikasotthi-Sala) built in various parts of the country. This is the earliest documentary evidence we have of institutions specifically dedicated to the care of the sick anywhere in the world.[63][64]\u00a0Mihintale\u00a0Hospital is the oldest in the world...

Sinhalese Medicine resembles some of Ayurvedic practices in contrast for some treatments they use Buddhist Chantings (Pirith) in order to strengthen the effectiveness.\r\nAccording to the\u00a0Mahavamsa, the ancient chronicle,\u00a0Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka\u00a0(437 BC-367 BC) had lying-in-homes and Ayurvedic hospitals (Sivikasotthi-Sala) built in various parts of the country. This is the earliest documentary evidence we have of institutions specifically dedicated to the care of the sick anywhere in the world.[63][64]\u00a0Mihintale\u00a0Hospital is the oldest in the world...",

The Sinhalese people speak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhala_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinhala</a>, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_languages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indo-Aryan language</a>, and are predominantly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theravada Buddhists</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people#cite_note-Language-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[12]</a> although a small percentage of Sinhalese follow branches of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christianity</a>. The Sinhalese are mostly found in North Central, Central, South, and West Sri Lanka. According to the 5th century epic poem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavamsa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mahavamsa</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipavamsa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dipavamsa</a>, a 3rd–5th century treatise written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pali</a> by Buddhist monks of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anuradhapura_Maha_Viharaya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sri Lanka</a>, the Sinhalese descend from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo_Aryan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indo Aryan</a> settlers who came to the island in 543 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BCE</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhapura" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinhapura</a>, in India, led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Vijaya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prince Vijaya</a>.</p>

<p>Traditionally during recreation the Sinhalese wear a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarong" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>sarong</u></a><u> </u>(<em>sarama</em> in Sinhala). Men may wear a long-sleeved shirt with the sarong, while women wear a tight-fitting, short-sleeved jacket with a wrap-around called the <em>cheeththaya</em>. In the more populated areas, Sinhalese men also wear Western-style clothing — wearing suits while the women wear skirts and blouses. For formal and ceremonial occasions women wear the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kandyan</a> (Osaria) style, which consists of a full blouse which covers the midriff completely, and is partially tucked in at the front. However, modern intermingling of styles has led to most wearers baring the midriff. The Kandyan style is considered as the national dress of Sinhalese women. In many occasions and functions, even the <em>saree</em> plays an important role in women's clothing and has become the de facto clothing for female office workers especially in government sector. An example of its use is the uniform of air hostesses of Sri-Lanka AirLine.</p>

<h1><strong><u>Religion</u></strong></h1>
<p> </p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../../upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Sri_Lanka_-_Religion_2012.png" alt="Religion in Sri Lanka - Wikipedia" /></p>
<p>The form of Buddhism in Sri Lanka is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theravada</a> (school of elders). The Pali chronicles (e.g., the Mahavansa) claim that the Sinhalese as an ethnic group are destined to preserve and protect Buddhism. In 1988 almost 93% of the Sinhala speaking population in Sri Lanka were Buddhist.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people#cite_note-lcweb2.loc.gov-42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[42]</a> Observations of current religious beliefs and practices demonstrate that the Sinhalese, as a religious community, have a complex worldview as Buddhists. Due to the proximity and on some occasions similarity of certain doctrines, there are many areas where Buddhists and Hindus share religious views and practices. This can lead to the opinion that Buddhists have adopted religious elements from Hindu traditions in their religious practices. Some of these practices may relate to ancient indigenous beliefs and traditions on spirits, worship of deities and godlings and some figures appear to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demons_of_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demons</a>. Some of these demonic figures are used in healing rituals and may be native to the island.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people#cite_note-everyculsin-39" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[39]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people#cite_note-Buddhism_transformed-43" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[43]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people#cite_note-kataragama.org-44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[44]</a></p>
<p>Prominent Sri Lankan anthropologists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gananath_Obeyesekere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gananath Obeyesekere</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kitsiri_Malalgoda&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kitsiri Malalgoda</a> used the term "Protestant Buddhism" to describe a type of Buddhism that appeared among the Sinhalese in Sri Lanka as a response to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Christian" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protestant Christian</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">missionaries</a> and their evangelical activities during the British colonial period. This kind of Buddhism involved emulating the Protestant strategies of organising religious practices. They saw the need to establish Buddhist schools for educating Buddhist youth and organising Buddhists with new organisations such as the Young Men's Buddhist Association, as well as printing pamphlets to encourage people to participate in debates and religious controversies to defend Buddhism.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people#cite_note-45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[45]</a></p>
<p>There is a significant Sinhalese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian</a> community, in the maritime provinces of Sri Lanka.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people#cite_note-everyculsin-39" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[39]</a> Christianity was brought to the Sinhalese by Portuguese, Dutch, and British missionary groups during their respective periods of rule.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people#cite_note-46" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[46]</a> Most Sinhalese Christians are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roman Catholic</a>; a minority are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protestant</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people#cite_note-lcweb2.loc.gov-42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[42]</a> Their cultural centre is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negombo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Negombo</a>.</p>
<p>Religion is considered very important among the Sinhalese. According to a 2008 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallup_poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup poll</a>, 99% of Sri Lankans considered religion an important aspect of their daily lives..</p>

<p>Sinhalese cuisine is one of the most complex cuisines of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Asia</a>. As a major trade hub, it draws influence from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_powers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colonial powers</a> that were involved in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sri Lanka</a> and by foreign traders. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rice</a>, which is consumed daily, can be found at any occasion, while spicy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">curries</a> are favourite dishes for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lunch</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dinner</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people#cite_note-57" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[57]</a> Some of the Sri Lankan dishes have striking resemblance to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_cuisine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kerala cuisine</a>, which could be due to the similar geographic and agricultural features with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kerala</a>. A well-known rice dish with Sinhalese is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiribath" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kiribath</a>, meaning "Milk Rice." In addition to sambols, Sinhalese eat "Mallung"- chopped leaves mixed with grated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coconut</a> and red <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">onions</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_milk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coconut milk</a> is found in most Sri Lankan dishes to give the cuisine its unique flavour.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka has long been renowned for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spices</a>. The best known is cinnamon which is native to Sri Lanka. In the 15th and 16th centuries, spice and ivory traders from all over the world who came to Sri Lanka brought their native cuisines to the island, resulting in a rich diversity of cooking styles and techniques. Lamprais rice boiled in stock with a special <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">curry</a>, accompanied by <em>frikkadels</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meatballs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meatballs</a>), all of which is then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked as a Dutch-influenced Sri Lankan dish. Dutch and Portuguese sweets also continue to be popular. British influences include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_beef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roast beef</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_chicken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roast chicken</a>. Also, the influence of the Indian cooking methods and food have played a major role in what Sri Lankans eat.</p>
<p>The island nation's cuisine mainly consists of boiled or steamed rice served with curry. This usually consists of a "main curry" of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_(food)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fish</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(food)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chicken</a>, as well as several other curries made with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vegetables</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lentils</a> and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fruit</a> curries. Side-dishes include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickled_cucumber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pickles</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chutney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chutneys</a> and "sambols". The most famous of these is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Sambola_(Coconut_Sambol)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coconut sambol</a>, made of ground coconut mixed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chili peppers</a>, dried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldive_fish" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maldive fish</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_juice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lime juice</a>. This is ground to a paste and eaten with rice, as it gives zest to the meal and is believed to increase appetite.</p>

<p>Dramatist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ediriweera_Sarachchandra" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ediriweera Sarachchandra</a> revitalised the drama form with <em>Maname</em> in 1956.

<p>Traditional Sinhalese villages in early days had at least one chief Medical personnel called Weda Mahaththaya (Doctor). These people practice their clinical activities by inheritance. Sinhalese Medicine resembles some of Ayurvedic practices in contrast for some treatments they use Buddhist Chantings (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paritta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pirith</a>) in order to strengthen the effectiveness.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavamsa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mahavamsa</a>, the ancient chronicle, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandukabhaya_of_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka</a> (437 BC-367 BC) had lying-in-homes and Ayurvedic hospitals (Sivikasotthi-Sala) built in various parts of the country. This is the earliest documentary evidence we have of institutions specifically dedicated to the care of the sick anywhere in the world.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people#cite_note-63" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[63]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people#cite_note-64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[64]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihintale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mihintale</a> Hospital is the oldest in the world...</p> </div><!--/blog_post_content-->
